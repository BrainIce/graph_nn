# Graph U-Net

My attempt to reproduce graph classification results from recent papers [[1](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJePRoAct7), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01287)] using Graph U-Net.

This repository contains all necessary data for the PROTEINS dataset. It can be found [here](https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets) along with similar datasets.

The baseline model is Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) [[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907)].

Hyperparameters are used from [2].
